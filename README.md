# Scan Overflow

Scan Overflow is a **Satisfactory** mod designed to improve the scanning system by adding a cyclable paging system for both the resource scanner and object scanner. This mod aims to alleviate the overcrowding of the scanning wheel, particularly when multiple mods are installed that add new resources. The paging system is fully clientside, allowing for a smooth and customizable experience.
